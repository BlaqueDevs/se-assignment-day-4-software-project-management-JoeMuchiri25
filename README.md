## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Version control are systems that record changes to files over time, enabling developers to track  and revert to previous versions of their code. They have several concepts including: Repository, which is a collection of files that tracks changes done.Commit, which is an overview of the project at a certain time. Branching. which allows developers to work on features or bug fixes in certain environments. Others are Merging, Conflict and History.
GitHub is popular for its detailed history tracking,  ease of collaboration, and powerful branching and merging features.
